#Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health-related features using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is publicly available and contains various health attributes such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and more.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques for classification problems, focusing on model training, evaluation, and prediction.

üß† Project Overview
This project implements a Diabetes Prediction model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained and evaluated to predict the outcome (whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not).

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Python
Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical computing
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models
StandardScaler: For feature scaling
üìä Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, available at UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It contains 768 samples and 8 feature columns:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Blood pressure value
SkinThickness: Thickness of skin fold
Insulin: Insulin levels
BMI: Body Mass Index
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age of the patient
Outcome: 1 if the person has diabetes, 0 if not
üöÄ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed and then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Code
bash
Copy
Edit
python diabetes_prediction.py
This will train the model, make predictions, and output the accuracy.

üîç Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and normalized using StandardScaler to improve model performance.
Model Training: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to train the model on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Accuracy is calculated on both training and test sets to assess the performance of the model.
Visualizations: Plots are used to visualize the dataset and the model's performance.
üìù Results
After training and evaluating the model, the results showed an accuracy of approximately 85%, indicating that the SVM model is fairly accurate for predicting diabetes in this dataset.

üîÑ Next Steps
Experiment with other machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
Implement cross-validation to improve model performance.
Enhance the dataset with additional features and data sources for more accurate predictions.
Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
